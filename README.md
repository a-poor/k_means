# k-Means Clustering Visualization
A visualization of the k-means clustering algorithm created in javascript, using P5.js, based on the method described in the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) article.

Points are randomly generated and the k-means are initialized using the [Forgy method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#Initialization_methods), where k observations are selected from the dataset and used as the initial means.
